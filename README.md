"Day-Tra"ã€€is an online service for programming beginners to learn web development and get practical skills. It provides teaching videos and mockups (designs) for projects.
After learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I coded some demo sites including a WordPress site based on the mockups for about 6 months.
